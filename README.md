# RAGify
A Python library for generating embeddings from various file types (text, PDFs, DOCX, images, and videos) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. Ragify processes files, generates embeddings using state-of-the-art models, and saves them as JSON files for easy integration into RAG pipelines.
